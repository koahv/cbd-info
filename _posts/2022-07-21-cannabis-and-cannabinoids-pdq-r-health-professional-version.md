[22] Similarly, a study of a subset of cancer patients in the Minnesota medical Cannabis program explored changes in the severity of eight symptoms (i.e., anxiety, appetite loss, depression, disturbed sleep, fatigue, nausea, pain, and vomiting) experienced by these patients.[23]. Pain. [64] In a randomized, placebo-controlled, graded-dose trial, opioid-treated cancer patients with poorly controlled chronic pain demonstrated significantly better control of pain and sleep disruption with THC:CBD oromucosal spray at lower doses (1–4 and 6–10 sprays/d), compared with placebo. [66] An observational study assessed the effectiveness of nabilone in advanced cancer patients who were experiencing pain and other symptoms (anorexia, depression, and anxiety).
