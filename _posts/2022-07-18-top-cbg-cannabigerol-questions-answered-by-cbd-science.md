CBG, or Cannabigerol, is derived from the cannabis plant and is commonly called “the mother of all cannabinoids” or the “stem cell cannabinoid” because many other cannabinoids come from CBGA, the acidic form of CBG. Another difference between the two cannabinoids is how they work within the body. Is CBD or CBG better for anxiety? Both CBD and CBG can be used to treat anxiety. To answer the question of which cannabinoid is better for treating anxiety, CBG seems to be better at treating anxiety but doesn’t have as much research available when compared to people using CBD to treat anxiety.
