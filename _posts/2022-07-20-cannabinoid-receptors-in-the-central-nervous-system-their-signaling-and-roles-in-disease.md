We will introduce the two major receptors, focusing on the CB 1 receptors due to their high expression levels in the CNS; their endogenous ligands or endocannabinoids (eCB) and some synthetic mimetics that activate and modulate their signaling; the signaling pathways that connect this receptor to processes inside the cell; and the role of the CB system in the normally functioning CNS and its alteration or therapeutic modulation in a variety of disease states.
