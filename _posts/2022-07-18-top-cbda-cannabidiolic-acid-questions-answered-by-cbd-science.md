CBDA is most commonly used by people who prefer the raw and unprocessed form of CBD. You can still find some products that include CBDA in them, but itâ€™s most common to see CBD and CBDA combined into one product. The body can also process CBD more easily than CBDA, which in turn allows the body to use CBD more effectively. Most CBDA products are blended with some form of CBD in order to make the product more effective. Just like CBDA vapes and extracts, CBDA flowers allow the cannabinoid to be absorbed into your bloodstream via the lungs, thus never being processed by your digestive system.
