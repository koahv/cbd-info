Scientists have found more than 100 cannabinoids. The most commonly known cannabinoids are Delta-9 THC and cannabidiol (CBD). There is one CBD product, Epidiolex, that the FDA approved for use with medical supervision to treat seizures in limited cases. There are also three FDA-approved synthetic cannabis-related products to treat nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Cannabinoids like Delta-8 THC and HHC have appeared more recently in the marketplace.
