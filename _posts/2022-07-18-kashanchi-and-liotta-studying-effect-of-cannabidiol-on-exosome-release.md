TLR3?is a member of the toll-like receptor family of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system. The researchers have two aims for their work. First, they intend to define the mechanisms of cannabinoid-mediated decreased EV production and release in HIV-1 infected cells. Second, they aim to determine the effect of CBD and THC on HIV-1 expression using 3D neurospheres. The researchers will receive total funding of $450,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for this research.
