What is Delta-8 THC? Delta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8 for short) is a legal cannabinoid that can give you a heady high while only containing 0.3% THC, the same as CBD. Unfortunately, taking Delta-8 THC can cause you to fail a drug test. If you’re looking to experience a heady high, you may be disappointed. The Delta-8 in topicals will most likely target the painful area for pain relief, but since it is not absorbed past the dermal layer, it won’t cause you to feel any high as it cannot be probably absorbed by the bloodstream.
